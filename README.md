# Aoi-Pumper
Aoi Pumper is a file pumper made in .NET framework 4.0, and has the aim to increase a files size with junk data, in order to seem more "legitimate". The typical use of this program is in malware, as malware authors may want to try and evade an anti virus sandbox by making it too large for it to handle, or trick a user into thinking it's a larger program.

Since this was just pure winforms, it's very ugly, but functional.
